## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Very simple C++ calculator. Made using C++ only to have some practice with it.

## 💿 Working Principle <a name = "built_using"></a>

- Program asks user to input number one
- Program asks user to input number two
- Program asks user to input the type of operation he wants to be performed
- Depending on the operation type entered, program will calculate the result
  - if user entered +, result will be A + B
  - if user entered -, result will be A - B
  - if user entered _, result will be A _ B
  - if user entered /, result will be A / B
  - if user entered ^, result will be A ^ B
  - if user entered another sign, program will output an error message
- Program outputs the result and exits
